# CountryData_Clustering
Socioeconomic data is a valuable resource for understanding how different factors can affect the 
development of a nation. One way to get insights from the data is to group countries with similar 
attributes. Clustering methods are an Unsupervised Machine Learning method that can find groups in the data.    
The data set contains indicators of social and economic development such as gdpp, life expectancy, income, and fertility rate. 
Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of socioeconomic development that is calculated from other factors. 
The three components of HDI are life expectancy, education index, and GNI index. This composite indicator is used to categorize 
countries as either developed with HDI greater than 0.8 or developing with HDI less than 0.8. This notebook will show 
different clustering methods and also demonstrate if clustering will improve the results of classification methods.
